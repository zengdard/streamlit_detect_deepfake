This is a Python script for a Streamlit app that uses a pre-trained Keras model to classify images as "fake" or "real". The script first sets up the app's layout and title, then loads the model from a local file or downloads it from Hugging Face if it's not found. It then defines several functions for processing and filtering images, and uses these functions to classify an image uploaded by the user.

Here's a brief overview of the script's functionality:

* The script sets up the app's layout and title using Streamlit.
* It loads the pre-trained Keras model from a local file or downloads it from Hugging Face if it's not found.
* It defines a function `download_file` to download a file from a URL and save it to a local path.
* It defines a function `load_keras_model_from_hub` to download a Keras model from Hugging Face and save it to a local path.
* It defines a function `apply_fake_filter` to apply a filter to an image based on its predicted class and confidence score.
* It defines a function `prepare_image` to preprocess an image and convert it to a format suitable for the model.
* It defines a function `convert_to_ela_image` to convert an image to an ELA (Error Level Analysis) image, which is used to detect manipulations in the image.
* It uses Streamlit's `file_uploader` widget to allow the user to upload an image.
* It uses the pre-trained model to classify the uploaded image as "fake" or "real".
* It applies the `apply_fake_filter` function to the uploaded image based on its predicted class and confidence score.
* It displays the filtered image using Streamlit's `image` widget.
* It displays a markdown message with information about the source of the data used to train the model.

Here's a more detailed explanation of the script's functionality:

### Import necessary libraries

The script imports several libraries, including `os`, `requests`, `keras`, `streamlit`, `PIL`, and `numpy`. It also sets the `HUGGINGFACE_TOKEN` environment variable to a specific value, which is used to authenticate with Hugging Face when downloading the model.

### Set up app layout and title

The script uses Streamlit's `set_page_config` function to set the app's title and layout. It sets the title to "Fake Photo Identifier (Beta) - StendhalGPT Gogh" and the layout to "wide".

### Load pre-trained Keras model

The script tries to load the pre-trained Keras model from a local file named "model\_casia\_run1.h5". If the file is not found, it downloads the model from Hugging Face using the `load_keras_model_from_hub` function. It then compiles the model using the Adam optimizer, binary cross-entropy loss, and accuracy metric.

### Define functions for processing and filtering images

The script defines several functions for processing and filtering images. The `download_file` function downloads a file from a URL and saves it to a local path. The `load_keras_model_from_hub` function downloads a Keras model from Hugging Face and saves it to a local path. The `apply_fake_filter` function applies a filter to an image based on its predicted class and confidence score. The `prepare_image` function preprocesses an image and converts it to a format suitable for the model. The `convert_to_ela_image` function converts an image to an ELA (Error Level Analysis) image, which is used to detect manipulations in the image.

### Allow user to upload an image

The script uses Streamlit's `file_uploader` widget to allow the user to upload an image in JPG, JPEG, or PNG format. If an image is uploaded, it is opened using PIL's `Image.open` function and saved to a local file.

### Classify uploaded image

The script uses the pre-trained Keras model to classify the uploaded image as "fake" or "real". It first preprocesses the image using the `prepare_image` function, then reshapes it to a format suitable for the model. It then uses the `predict` function to get the predicted class and confidence score for the
